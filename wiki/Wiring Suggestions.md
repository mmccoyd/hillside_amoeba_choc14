# Suggestions for wiring

There are many ways to wire up a Dactyl,
  these steps were useful for me.

## Solder the wires on top of the pads, not through them

The switch sits directly on the front of the amoeba,
  so a wire with a solder cone sticking through there
  won't help the switch anchor firmly in the amoeba and hotswap socket.

## Tin the amoebas and add Mil-Max while still in the panel

They're much easier to handle while still in a big clump.

## Use the extra column pad for the MCU connection

Using the unused one at the very top or bottom of the column
  may be harder due to the keywell walls.

## Use a keywell without the walls as a wiring aid

Wiring the amoebas without case sidewalls in the way may be easier.
An extra copy of the upper surface of the case can be printed as
a wiring and distance judge aid.
But you would need separate ones for each side.
It is likely not needed, but could be easier.
