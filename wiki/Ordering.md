# Ordering

I've ordered from JLC, who seem good for small personal runs.

It is possible any given diode choice may be out of stock.
If so you may need to switch between SOD-123 and SOD-323 footprints
  and recreate the panel.

Suitable JLC stock numbers are:

- SOD-123: C81598
- SOD-323: C2128

## Board order settings

- Layers: 2
- Delivery Format: Panel by Customer
- Panel Format: 6 x 4
- Thickness: 1.2 (As Mill-Max lip pushes board closer to Dactyl base.)

- Color, Finish: Your choice. ENIG isn't needed for keyboards.

- Confirm production file: I usually do yes when PCBA is involved.
- Remove Order number: Specify a location

## PCBA settings

- Economic, Top Side
- Tooling: Added by customer
- Confirm placement: Yes

## Bill of Materials

- File provided as: Complete file

## Component placement

- Confirm that their little diode images have the white bar
  on the same side as the silkscreen end with the solid bar,
    not the end that has no bar.
