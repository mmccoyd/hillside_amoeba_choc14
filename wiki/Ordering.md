# Ordering

I've ordered from JLC, which seems good for small personal runs.

## Part alternatives

Any diode choice might be out of stock at times, 
If so, various other diodes would work just fine,
 though sticking with the existing SOD-323 will be the easiest.
Or, possibly, you may need, or want, to switch between
  SOD-123 and SOD-323 footprints and recreate the panel.

Suitable JLC stock numbers include:

- SOD-323: C2128
- SOD-123: C81598
