# Project notes

### Building

Currently using a build plugin in the toolbar.

### Design

Choc 18 mm spacing doesn't leave much space for switch supports
  between the columns of a Dactyl keyboard.
This amoeba takes up less width under the switch
  thus allowing the column side supports to extend below the switch body
  into where the PCB would normally be, reducing the support issue.

- The PCB extends past the switch hole top and bottom edges
  so the case will hold it down when a switch is pulled or pushed up to remove
  the switch.
- Column and Row solder holes are offset from the edge center
  to allow a switch puller to grip and pull closer to the edge center.
  Though I'm not sure this matters.

The narrow width eliminated the LED, and they would have
  made soldering more difficult.
