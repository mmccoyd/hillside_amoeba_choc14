# Design choices

## Panel is 6 columns x 4 rows, matching each board half

Hand wiring is easier with the panel layout and spacing
  matching the built layout.
The minimum JLC order of five panels gives sufficient extra
  for two complete Dactyls,
  which seems ideal for personal orders.
Shops can add a few spare separated amoebas as needed.

## Wiring holes are 1.6 mm, able to solder on top or fit solid core 22 AWG

Big enough to get bent tip of bare solid wire in
  and possibly insulation tip of silicone stranded wire.

- 26 AWG stranded silicon wire has OD 1.4 +- 0.1 mm
- 22 AWG solid hookup wire insulation has OD 1.5 mm
