# Change Log


## 0.1.0-alpha.4

Not yet tested. But the changes are simple and here for those who will be hand
soldering.

-   SOD-123 diodes for easier hand soldering.
-   Silk
    -   Fewer silk wire tick marks as they add clutter when doing
        post-solder cleanup.
    -   Logo on panel lower rail.
    -   Fix panel typo on choc column width.


## 0.1.0-alpha.3

This version has wording and layout improvements, tooling hole and
fiducial mark moves, and an update to KiCad 9.

This isn't an essential update. The previous version, 0.1.0-alpha.2
works just as well.

I haven't fabricated this version yet.
But the changes are simple and I created a JLC order without issue.

Changes

-   Panel
    -   Tooling holes and fiducial marks moved to side rails.
    -   Re-insert Amoeba after its version bump.
-   Panel silk
    -   More notes on use.
    -   Auxiliary information moved to the side panels.
-   Amoebas

Alpha.3 is the last version using the smaller SOD-323 diodes.


## 0.1.0-alpha.2

-   Amoeba 
    -   Matching holes offset for easier wire slack.
    -   Oval soldering holes.

        -   Typical wiring layout around the back outer frame.
