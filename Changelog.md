# Change Log

## 0.1.0-alpha.3

This version has wording and layout improvements.
Plus tooling hole and fiducial mark moves and an update to KiCad 9.

This isn't an essential update.
The previous version, 0.1.0-alpha.2 works just as well.

I haven't fabricated this version yet.
But the changes are simple and I created a JLC order without issue.
