# Amoeba Choc 14

A single-switch Amoeba PCB for choc Dactyl keyboards
  that allows choc 18 mm or narrower column spacing,
  sturdier column walls,
  and Mill-Max hotswap.

TODO: update: With socket STEP file for use in keywell design.

## Status

- Amoeba likely fine, as is panel
- panel in in JLC order
- Build done with JLC button, not CI
- CI works for pos file, but not BOM, needs doc half as well

## Next

## Later

- Fix up CI
- Maybe panel of 6 x 4
