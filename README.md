# Amoeba Choc 14

A single-switch Amoeba PCB for choc Dactyl keyboards
  that allows choc 18 mm or narrower column spacing,
  sturdier column walls and Mill-Max hotswap.

Choc 18 mm spacing doesn't leave much space For switch supports
  between the columns of a Dactyl keyboard.
This amoeba takes up less width under the switch
  thus allowing the column side supports to extend below the switch body
  into where the PCB would normally be, reducing the support issue.

It supports Mill-Max hotswap sockets
  so that iterating on the Dactyl's keywell shape is easier;
  the key matrix wiring can be reused across keywell iterations.

There's no LED as there didn't seem to be room and it would
  make soldering much harder.

## Status

- Amoeba likely fine, as is panel
- Build done with JLC button, not CI

## Next for Alpha-1

- Re-plot to confirm JLC has final version.
- panel in JLC order

## Later

- Update: With socket STEP file for use in keywell design.
- Steal CI PCBA build from the MCU Corner project
